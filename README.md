# S5-shell

## Startup Instructions
* use  `requirements.txt` to get all required imports
* make sure `S5-S3conf` credentials file is in same directory as `S5.py`.
* start shell using python3 S5.py

## Operation Instructions
* To delete a folder with `cdelete`, it must be empty and you will need to use the `-d` flag in this format: `cdelete <folderName> -d`
* When refering to folders in commands, DO NOT add a `/`. ex: `ch_folder myFolder`
* exit using `exit` or `quit`
* for long version of list command, use `-l` flag. ex: `list -l`
* the `ch_folder` command supports and will try to interperet `..` within file paths. Other functions do not at the moment.

# Implementation Notes
* there exist multiple examples of code duplication within this shell. this WILL be refactored when time allows
* there exist examples of groups of helper functions that may deserve their own class. this MAY be refactored if time allows
